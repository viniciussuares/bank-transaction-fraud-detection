    "# About this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses the critical challenge of **bank transaction fraud detection and prevention**. Financial fraud represents a significant risk in the financial sector, leading to substantial losses and impacting customer trust. Developing robust methods to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions is therefore a key priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages a publicly available dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marusagar/bank-transaction-fraud-detection), containing valuable information on bank transactions. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of outperforming a baseline rule-based fraud detection strategy. **The goal is to achieve a more efficient and accurate system that delivers improved business outcomes through minimized fraud losses and enhanced security.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology employed in this project includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Acquisition: The dataset will be obtained via the Kaggle API and KaggleHub.\n",
    "2. Data Splitting: The data will be partitioned into training, validation, and test sets for rigorous model evaluation.\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA will be conducted on the training data to gain insights and inform feature engineering.\n",
    "4. Baseline Model (Rule-Based Strategy): A rule-based strategy will be defined and implemented as a performance benchmark.\n",
    "5. Preprocessing and Pipeline Creation: Preprocessing steps will be applied to the training data, and a pipeline will be constructed for efficient data transformation and modeling.\n",
    "6. Model Selection: Several suitable machine learning models will be explored and selected.\n",
    "7. Training and Hyperparameter Optimization: Selected models will be trained and their hyperparameters optimized using the validation set.\n",
    "8. Evaluation: The final models will be evaluated on the test set using relevant technical and financial metrics.\n",
    "9. Conclusion: The project will conclude with a summary of findings and an assessment of the approach's effectiveness."
